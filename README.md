# RT_to_mitigate_QBBAs
This repository provides code for our paper "Random Transformations to Mitigate Query-Based Black-Box Attacks"

We have modified the codebase of BlackBox Bench (https://github.com/SCLBD/BlackboxBench) and the Robustness Library (https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness).

The ResNet-50 models can be obtained from the Robustness Library (https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness). The ImageNet test images can be retrieved from TREMBA (https://github.com/TransEmbedBA/TREMBA).

We provide the CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet shuffled images in our repository. 

We recommend running the code on SPYDER IDE using Anaconda.
